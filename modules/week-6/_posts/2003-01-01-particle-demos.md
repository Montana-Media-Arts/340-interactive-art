Please work through the following tutorial videos to go deeper with particle systems.

Let's apply some of previous concepts to the particles.

## Audio Reactivity and Particles

This tutorial may be a bit behind the times, but go ahead and give it a shot if you're curious. 
In this by [bileam tschepe (elekktronaut) - Audioreactive Particle Cloud â€“ TouchDesigner Tutorial 10](https://youtu.be/M8X_FFB-ikQ) tutorial work through designing a particle cloud that then morphs and dances with music or sound. 

Alternatively, here's a more up-to-date option for you to explore.

## Mouse Tracking and Particles

This tutorial by [Kaiho Nishimura- touchdesigner tutorial - Particle tracking the mouse](https://youtu.be/dYyzK7_rLJg) looks at designing a particle cloud that can then be manipulated with mouse tracking.
