Let's apply some of previous concepts to the particles and dive deeper.

## Audio Reactivity and Particles

In this by [bileam tschepe (elekktronaut) - Audioreactive Particle Cloud – TouchDesigner Tutorial 10](https://youtu.be/M8X_FFB-ikQ) tutorial work through designing a particle cloud that then morphs and dances with music or sound.
