For this week, I want you to create an _ORIGINAL_ artwork that explores the ideas of particle systems.



Please take this as an opportunity to play and explore.

## Specifications

1. The work of art should explore particle systems as a creative concept
2. Incorporate interactivity to drive the particle system
3. Keep notes about your experimental process


## Deliverables

Follow the submission guide from [Week 2](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/340-interactive-art/modules/week-2/homework/) .

1. TouchDesigner Network
	1. You are required to submit your TouchDesigner Network this week.
	2. To do this, you will need to _zip_ the containing project folder for the network.
	3. If you have any media assets that you are utilizing (_this would only be the case if you added something beyond the tutorial_), please remember to include those within the network project directory, so that they are also zipped.
2. Screen Shots, Capture, and Renders
	1. Create a video of your TouchDesigner work using the [_Movie File Out_ operator, as discussed in this week]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-3/recordVideoOut/).
	2. Alternatively, you can use [OBS to take a screen recording of your TouchDesigner network and resulting output]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-2/captureYourDisplay/).
	3. Include audio (if you are using it) in your final video
	4. Take detailed Screen Shots of your node network for documentation.
3. Write Up: Provide written documentation of process and experience with this project.
	1. Describe the art work.  What are some key creative decisions you made?
	2. What modality of interactivity did you use? How does the modality of interactivity you chose drive the art work?
	3. Did you run into any problems and what were your solutions?
	4. What's next? 
	5. How was your experience working in TouchDesigner this week?  Are you happy with what emerged?
4. Check out your colleagues work for this week.  Leave a comment or a brief critique.
