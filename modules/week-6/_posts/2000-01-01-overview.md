This week, you are going to follow along with another tutorial that explores generative art utilizing a 3D workflow. The goal of this is for you to continue building up your TouchDesigner skills and knowledge, so that we can start moving towards your ability to use TouchDesigner as an extension of your artistic voice.

As far as new content, the one tutorial is it for this week. For the rest of the week, I want you to create a derivative artwork based on the four tutorials from the last two weeks.
