## Due Date

**Final Project Due Date - _Monday, April 19th, @ 11:59pm_**


## Specifications

To conclude your experience this semester with this course, you are be expected to create a final media art-based project, using TouchDesigner.

Per the [introduction of the final project]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-10/overview/), this final project artwork should explore a topic of interest you have. Furthermore, building on the work from this semester, this work should be developed in TouchDesigner.

You should have submitted a final project proposal as part of the week 10 homework. Assuming you have done this, you will have received feedback _if your proposal was problematic_ otherwise, your proposal was acceptable, and you should be working on it.

>If you have not submitted a final project proposal, please [email me](mailto:michael.musick@umontana.edu?subject=Final Project Proposal for MART 340) directly with a final project proposal ASAP.

You are welcome to pursue whatever project and topic is most interesting to you for this final project. My hope is, that you pick something that is useful to your larger artistic and career goals/directions _OR_ that you choose a topic that is highly interesting to yourself.

**{ NOTE: }** This work should be the equivalent complexity and time commitment to approximately 3 weeks worth of a _normal_ homework assignment for this course.



## Submission

Please submit your final project as a new forum post to the Final Project Submission Forum on Moodle.

- [Final Project Submission Forum on Moodle](https://moodle.umt.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=1714426)

### Deliverables

To submit this work, you will upload;

1. The TouchDesigner Network file, along with any associated external media. This should be uploaded as a `.zip` file.
2. A video capture representing the artwork in the best way possible. (_This will likely be a video recording of the TD output in "performance" mode._)
	- This be a high-quality capture of your TD network using the [_Movie File Out_ TOP]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-4/recordVideoOut/).
	- Alternatively, this could be a [screen capture]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-4/captureYourDisplay/) of the network, working on your computer.
	- Regardless, this video should include;
		- a title screen (this should at minimum include; your name, the work's title, and the year made)
		- a final credits screen (include the title of the work again)
		- appropriate credits
		- high-quality sound (if appropriate)
	- **{ NOTE: } _This will be the primary file used to assess the success of your final project! Please make this video the best representation you can._**
	- Preferred delivery is a public YouTube link. Alternatively, you can submit an _unlisted_ link or upload a file (if small enough).
3. A discussion of your experience, the artwork, and future work you intend to complete with TouchDesigner.
	- This brief description can also include any information you may want myself and the grading TA's to know about your work.
	- This does not need to be too long of a writing.
	- You will upload this as text to your forum submission.





## Group Critique

Following the submission of your final projects, the TA's and myself will meet to film a live-streamed critique of your projects. This will likely occur **Thursday, November 12th @ 8AM**. Details will follow.

You will be expected to watch this event in real-time or afterwards via video link. You will be expected to watch this video. After watching the video, you will be asked to write a reflection paper about the critique, your experience with your final project, your reaction to the rest of the classes final projects, and reflecting on your individual experience in the class. These will be due **Wednesday November 18th**. (_More information to come after the submission of final projects._)
