## Description

What is interactivity? What does it mean to create meaningful interactive experiences? In this hands-on course, students learn how to create interactive works and environments. We talk about what it means to create an interactive experience for general participants. Scale, space, and time are explored with reference to the body, while creating cybernetic systems for real-time and time-based interaction. Software, electronics, and physical computing are discussed, with the goal of students' creating physical projects. A variety of input and output mechanisms, networking, and best practices will be covered in lecture. Class discussions will cover readings about interactive art/music, design, space, and installation. Students are free to explore their own ideas through the lens of this course.

This course will include a heavy technical introduction to modern tools, as well as a mix of reading, discussion, interactive development, and projects.



## Objectives & Student Learning Outcomes

Through this course, students are expected to;

- Illustrate an understanding about interactive art and interactive theory
- Become versed in some of the tools and techniques available for the creation of interactive artworks, including;
	- real-time render development environments
    - real-time digital signal processing
    - data capture, including;
        - symbolic controllers (MIDI)
        - audio signals via microphones
        - physical computing (buttons, sensors, or basic electronics)
        - computer vision (edge detection, face recognition)
    - immersive environment construction
- Evaluate experience differences for various types of interactive works;
    - Web-based verse Physical-based works/experiences
    - time-dependent or input-dependent works/experiences
- Distinguish the difference between reactive, interactive, and dynamically changing systems.

Students are expected to bring ideas to explore these techniques. The goals of the projects are not simply about the successful application of the technical processes. Instead, the goal is to integrate these technical elements to make work that is meaningful.

This course will conclude with an intensive project. The goal of this artistic work is to incorporate the interactive theory, art, and concepts discussed during the first half of the course. The latter half of the course will be devoted to designing, composing, and building work. This will give students a real-world experience.

## Course Modality/Format

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the Department of Media Arts has moved all of our classes to online/asynchronous or remote/synchronous for the 2020/21 academic year. As a result, this course will be delivered via an _online/asynchronous_ modality. This means all content is available via the web, for you to approach each week on your own schedule.

Additionally, I will hold an optional Zoom-based lectures. This lecture will not cover new material or material beyond the content available each week via the web. However, it will serve as an opportunity for students to hear about the content from me directly, engage with me, and ask questions.

#### Course Recording

This serves as an explicit declaration that all courses meetings may be recorded. These will then be available for further study at a later time by students of the course.


## Course Websites

This course will be facilitated via multiple web technologies.

- Moodle -- Moodle will serve as a secure location for you to submit homework, receive feedback, and engage in discussion forums with your colleagues.
- Content Website -- Content for this site will primarily exist on an exterior website, hosted via GitHub. This is where you will complete most of your learning.

## Pre-Requisites

This course does have a pre-requirement that you have successfully taken _Creative Coding 1 (MART 120)_. For those of you who requested overrides into the course or waving of this requirement, you may need to spend extra time on the technical aspects of this course to stay caught-up.

It is also advised that have completed Creative Coding 2 (MART 220), as well as Web Development and Web Technologies (MART 341/441).

Additionally, you are expected to utilize your previous expertise in coding, content creation, story telling, art, sculpture, sound, music, dance, etc. towards the projects presented in the course.


## Books, Supplies, & Technology

This course does require your purchase or acquisition of some software and technology.

### Software

You will be required to have a development environment installed on your computer for assignments this semester. For this semester, instruction of technology specific skills will be demonstrated and taught in [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca).

> **The makers of TouchDesigner describe it as follows;**
>
> TouchDesigner is a visual development platform that equips you with the tools you need to create stunning realtime projects and rich user experiences.  Whether you're creating interactive media systems, architectural projections, live music visuals, or rapid-prototyping your latest ideas, TouchDesigner is the platform that can do it all.

TouchDesigner is a widely used development platform within the creative coding community. As such we will be learning it this semester. In addition to its incredible power and agility, TouchDesigner operates under a financially accessible model, with a free, "non-commercial" license.

<!--
For this semester, instruction of technology specific skills will be demonstrated and taught in [Ableton Live](https://www.ableton.com/en/shop/education/). This is an industry standard for creative applications with audio and sound. This is also a piece of software that will be taught in courses throughout the sonic arts track.

You are encouraged to purchase this software or utilize media art's computer labs, where it is available for student use.
-->


### Books

There are no required texts that you must purchase for this course. All readings, music, or sound examples will be available to you through web links, the library, or the class Moodle.


# Policies

## Course Evaluation

Student work and progress will be assessed through;

- Large Projects
	- There will be a number of larger assigned projects throughout the semester that relate to the current topics being discussed. These are the students opportunity to synthesis creative concerns and technical concerns from multiple weeks of content into significant artworks.
- Project Presentation
    - At least one of the projects from this semester are required to be presented publicly. These will likely occur through course organized shows.
- Project Documentation
	- Each large project will require project documentation, including; a demo video, academic report describing aesthetic and technical success in relation to the larger field, and a written description.
- In-class discussions and critiques
    - You are expected to engage with class discussions about technical and artistic issues.
    - You are expected to engage with class discussions about outside readings, videos, and listenings.
    - You are expected to engage in class critique days of large projects.
- Smaller Weekly Exercises
	- During the technical development portion of the course, you will be expected to complete weekly assignments that allow you to develop your technical capabilities.
- Daily Sketching
	- After spending time developing technical skills, you will be asked to engage in a daily sketching practice.


#### Projects

We will have a number of larger projects throughout the course that are relevant to presented concepts, techniques, and creative ideas. These are the students opportunity to synthesis creative concerns and technical concerns from multiple weeks of content into singular artworks.

Project grades will be based primarily on the student’s ability to:

1.  Demonstrate an understanding of the specific characteristics and integrative capabilities of the assigned topic through artistic output, written documentation, and technical achievement.
2.  Articulate a clear and concise perspective within the artwork.
3.  Present an organized artistic piece, as well as; technical report, file/program structure, and demo video.
4.  Demonstrate engagement with an iterative process of ideation → creation → presentation → assessment.
5.  Demonstrate creativity beyond the expected technical requirements.
6.  Properly and punctually deliver all assignment files.

**Please Note:** All Projects are required for this course. Failure to complete and submit a project will result in a failing grade for the course. There are no exceptions to this rule. Completion of this course requires all projects be completed.

#### Participation

This class will be participatory, and you are expected to participate in discussions and give feedback to other students.



## Grades

#### Final Grades

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:

- Forum-based participation, discussions, and critiques: 10%
- Creative and Technical Skill Development Projects: 50%
- Screening and Reading Responses: 15%
- Daily Sketching Practice: 10%
- Final Creative Project: 15%


Letters are assigned according to the following final course percentages:

| Grade | % Range 	|
|:-----:|:---------:|
| A  	| `[93-100]`|
| A- 	| `[90-93)`	|
| B+ 	| `[87-90)`	|
| B  	| `[83-87)`	|
| B- 	| `[80-83)`	|

| C- 	| `[70-73)`	|
| D  	| `[60-70)`	|
| F  	| `[0-60)`	|


#### Late Work

IMPORTANT: Since projects are experienced and critiqued as a group through the discussion forum critique model, late projects are not permissible and will not be accepted.

Documentation assignments or weekly sketches handed in after the due date and time will have points deducted for lateness. This will be in addition to any points deducted for content. Those that are uploaded late but within one day of the due date will lose 5% for lateness.  For those uploaded after that, the number of deducted points will be at the discretion of the professor, who reserves the right to no longer accept it.

#### COVID-19 Consideration

If you contract COVID-19 during the course of this semester, I will work with you to as is at all possible, to help you stay caught-up or to catch-up.

<!--
## Attendance

- Attendance will be taken at the beginning of every class
- Critique days are mandatory. No exceptions. No tardiness.
- Contact me in advance if you will not be in class. (email is preferred)
- Unexcused absences will affect your grade.
    - One absence is allowed; after that, your final overall grade for the course will drop by 2.5% for each additional absence.
- You are expected to work with colleagues to catch-up on what you missed.
--> 

## Zoom Related Information

Classes may be offered via Zoom, at the discretion of the instructor, or as a result of University policies.

<!--
#### Zoom Attendance

When class sessions occur via zoom, you are still expected to be present in class. Even though most classes will be recorded and these recordings can be used to experience the conversation that occurred, these do not substitute for an in-class experience. As such, absences from zoom-based class sessions will be considered unexcused absences from the course.
-->

#### Zoom Etiquette

When attending class via Zoom, you are expected to act similarly to how you would if attending in-person. This means:

- Students should plan on having their cameras on so that everyone in the class may engage with them via discussion. (The Instructor will inform students when it is appropriate or necessary for cameras to be off.)
- Students should ensure that they attend Zoom-based courses somewhere with a sufficiently fast and large-enough-bandwidth internet connection so as to facilitate multi-directional video conferencing.
- Students should ensure that they are presentable visually.
- Students should ensure that their camera background is professional and free from unnecessary visual/audio distractions.
- Students should position themselves so that they do not need to constantly move around their space with their camera.
- Students should ensure sufficient lighting for their faces, so that everyone can engage with them.
- Students should ensure that the quality of their audio (both microphone and speakers) are sufficient to facilitate high-quality conversation.




## Academic Honesty, Plagiarism, and Cheating Policy

Students are expected to adhere to academic conduct policies of the University of Montana as explained in Section V of your [University of Montana Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/student-affairs/dean-of-students/Student%20Conduct%20Code%20-%20FINAL%20-%208-24-18.pdf):  “Academic misconduct is subject to an academic penalty by the course instructor and/or a disciplinary sanction by the University.  Academic misconduct is defined as all forms of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to:  (1) plagiarism, (2) misconduct during an examination or academic exercise, (3) unauthorized possession of examination or other course materials, (4) tampering with course materials, (5) submitting false information, (6) submitting work previously presented in another course, (7) improperly influencing conduct, (8) substituting, or arranging substitution, for another student during an examination or other academic exercise, (9) facilitating academic dishonesty, and (10) Altering transcripts, grades, examinations, or other academically related documents.”

Dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. This includes, but is not limited to, cheating on tests, cheating on assignments, fabricating information or citations, having unauthorized possession of examinations, submitting work of another person or work previously used, or tampering with the academic work of other students.

Plagiarism is the presentation of the work of another without acknowledgment. As defined by the [University of Montana’s Student Conduct Code](http://www.umt.edu/vpsa/policies/default.php), plagiarism is “Representing another person's words, ideas, data, or materials as one's own.”  Students may use information and ideas expressed by others, but this use must be identified by appropriate referencing.

Students who cheat or plagiarize will receive academic sanctions, which may include an “F” grade on the assignment, examination, and/or in the course. Students will also be reported to the Dean of Students for possible further disciplinary action.

#### Using Code or Media Found Elsewhere

It is easy to find code and media (i.e. videos, sounds, images, etc.) online. If you use code or media from elsewhere (which you will at times), I expect you to cite the work and author.

If you use found code, you are expected to comment each line, as to what each line does programmatically. _Do not_ summarize several lines of code from a high level (i.e., TV Guide). I expect you to comment each line on a granular level. In addition, in these cases, I am also looking for significant modification of the code, for you to enact your own ideas and to experiment heavily. Significant modification means beyond variable name and value changes. It is bending these concepts to your idea, especially graphically. It is not a copy and paste job. Also, never more than 40% of your code may be supplied from elsewhere. Period. If you use code from online, whether for inspiration, modification or reference, I expect to see a link in your comments from where you got the code and who wrote it. Otherwise it will be considered as plagiarism, and you will fail the assignment. The code must have a reference, along with URL and be commented out LINE BY LINE.

If you use found media, *YOU* are responsible to ensure it is used according to fair-use guidelines. The pieces you make in this course are intended to be portfolio-quality works. Therefore, you should not utilize found media with restrictive use guidelines or licenses. You can read more about various licenses at;

- [opensource.guide](https://opensource.guide/legal/)
- [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com)
- [GNU Licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/licenses.en.html)
- [Creative Commons Licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/)
- [opensource.org](https://opensource.org/licenses)

For found media, you are also expected to cite the media in your documentation for the project.


## Sensitive Subject Matter & Censorship

This course operates under a no censorship policy, and you should feel free to experiment with challenging topics in your projects. That said - if you submit work with violent or sexually explicit themes, containing hate speech, racial slurs or other sensitive subject matter, I might contact you to request more background information on your choices.


## Be Kind

Be respectful to each other, help each other, and be considerate in your communications with the instructional team.  No trolling shared work and ideas. Be constructive with any critical feedback you give.

## Diversity Statement

Your experience in this class is important to me.  I welcome individuals of all backgrounds, beliefs, ethnicities, genders, gender identities, gender expressions, races, national origins, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, ages, abilities, and other visible and nonvisible differences. Please know that I will gladly honor your request to address you by an alternate name or gender pronoun.  All members of this class are expected to contribute to a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive environment for every other member of this class.


## Students with Disabilities

The University of Montana assures equal access to instruction through collaboration between students with disabilities, instructors, and Disability Services for Students. Students with disabilities are encouraged to plan ahead and can contact [Disability Services for Students (DSS)](http://www.umt.edu/dss/). If you think you may have a disability adversely affecting your academic performance, and you have not already registered with Disability Services, please contact Disability Services in Lommasson Center 154, or call (406)243-2243. I will work with you and Disability Services to provide an appropriate modification, that does not fundamentally alter the academic standards of the course.

## COVID-19 Specific Information

- Mask use is required if entering a classroom or if meeting with members of the University Community for official business.
- Each student is provided with a cleaning kit.  The expectation is that students will clean their personal space when they arrive for class or meetings, and before they leave the room.
- University spaces and rooms may have one-way entrances / exits to minimize crowding. Please follow these directions.
- Stay home if you feel sick and/or if exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms. Please cancel meetings.
- If you are sick or displaying symptoms, please contact the Curry Health Center at (406) 243-4330.
- If we have a meeting and you are sick or displaying symptoms, I will contact the Curry Health Center and also ask that we reschedule the meeting.
- Up-to-Date COVID-19 Information from the University of Montana
	- UM Coronavirus Website:  [https://www.umt.edu/coronavirus](https://www.umt.edu/coronavirus)
	- UM COVID-19 Fall 2020 website:  [https://www.umt.edu/coronavirus/fall2020.php](https://www.umt.edu/coronavirus/fall2020.php)

As a final reminder, we (The University Community) strongly encourage you to remain vigilant outside the classroom in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The only way for this semester to be successful and to maintain minimal interruptions to the our educational mission is to insure the safety and health of all members of our community. Please remember that all decisions and choices made during this time hold this idea above all others; that the safety and health of our entire community is our most important goal.

#### In Case the Instructor Becomes Sick

If I become sick from COVID-19 during the course of this semester, I will do everything I can to maintain my teaching and mentorship, utilizing the existing modalities established for this semester. However, I will obviously be unable to utilize my university office and will therefore have to make adjustments.

If I become unable to attend weekly class sessions, I will alter the course such that you may continue with your individual projects in an appropriate manner. I will also likely ask that you continue to meet as a cohort, so that you can support each other in your research and artistic pursuits.


## Changes to the Course

I reserve the right to change the intended content of this course throughout the semester. This may be done to adjust for the speed of the class, to better meet educational goals, or to account for changes in technology.
