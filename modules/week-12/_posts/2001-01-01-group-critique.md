Please watch the entire group critique video. When you are done, you are expected to write a reflection paper, which you will submit as a PDF to Moodle.

> Please write a 1-3 page reflection paper to close out the semester. Please save these files as PDFs and upload to this assignment module.
>
> The reflection paper should include the following:
>
> 1. Your reaction to the critique of your work,
> 2. A critique of your work in relation to the whole of everyone else's work.
> 3. Your reaction to the rest of the classes final projects
> 4. And finally, your reflections about your individual experience in the class. What did you take away, how will this effect your creative practice in the future, and what do you wish we did differently?
