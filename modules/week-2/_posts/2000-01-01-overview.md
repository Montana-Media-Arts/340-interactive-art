Homework Due: No Homework, LEARN TD

<br />


This week, is all about starting to learn [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/product).

You are going to spend the week essentially in a TouchDesigner bootcamp. I have four resources that I want you to work through;

1. A 20-minute TouchDesigner intro video
2. The "Getting Started" guide from Touch Designer
3. A 4-hour "Introduction to TouchDesigner" video
4. A TouchDesigner Introductory Book

This is admittedly a lot. So, you will not have homework this week, your task is to work through the above material, so that next week, we can start creating together.

Your work in the pre-req for this course [(MART 120 - Creative Coding 1)](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/creative-coding-1-Fall2019/) will help you get through this class and week. Draw on the skills you learned in that course for "problem solving", organization, and program flow.
