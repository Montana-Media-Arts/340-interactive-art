This week, is all about starting to learn [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca/product).

You are going to spend the week learning about TouchDesigner, what it can do, and complete a "Hello World" type exercise.

This is a deep-dive, TouchDesigner bootcamp kind of week. But by the end, you should have plenty of information to get moving with this semester.

This is admittedly a lot. But, we can do this together. Be patient, give yourself plenty of time, and enjoy!
