For this week's homework, you are expected to make a basic WebCam filter using TouchDesigner. You can start this project by following along with this week's content and tutorial video. Once you complete this week's content, I want you to go further in your piece by exploring TOP operators, experimenting with them, and finding out which ones and how you can implement them in your network.

## Specifications

1. Follow-along and create the basic WebCam filter network as demo'd this week.
2. Go beyond this basic network by exploring;
   1. Additional TOP operators
   2. Parameters of TOPs that you implement
   3. Ways of rearranging the network
3. Save your work along the way
4. Create a screen capture recording of your desktop showing your TouchDesigner WebCam network and preview display.
5. In addition, please take a moment to reflect and write about your experience this week using TouchDesigner. Feel free to let us know;
   1. How you like it?
   2. What problems you encountered?
   3. Anything else you deem relevant?

The following video serves as an example of what we are looking for this week. It shows the TouchDesigner network, resulting output, and captures my microphone, so we can hear any comments you may want to provide.

## Upload

You will upload your videos to the homework submission forum. These should be small enough to allow direct upload to Moodle ( < 500mb ). You should also paste in your response as text to the post. An example is provided on the submission forum.
