# Learning Resources

Obviously, we will be learning TD within this class. However, as mentioned, TouchDesigner is a complex program with a steep learning curve. It is therefore useful to have multiple pathways to learning about this program, as some will work better for certain of you. I would encourage you to familiarize yourself with some of the following, as additional resources for your TD adventure.

## nVoid TouchDesigner Book

The following book by nVoid is a great resource for reading about basic concepts in TD from a different voice. I would highly encourage you to download this book and read through chapter 8 over the next week.

- [_Introduction to TouchDesigner 099_. sponsored by nVoid. 2019. Available at: nvoid.github.io/book/en/introductiontotouchdesigner.pdf](https://nvoid.github.io/book/en/introductiontotouchdesigner.pdf)

## TD Wiki

The official TouchDesigner Wiki is another critical resource in problem solving and learning. I would bookmark this site.

- [TouchDesigner Documentation - Main Page](https://docs.derivative.ca/Main_Page)

# About TouchDesigner

To get started, please watch the following artist, _bileam tschepe_ from Berlin, overview of the environment from a high level. The following videos will then take you through some additional high-level details in a bit more depth.

**{ NOTE: }** _You can choose to follow along to the videos on this page or not. I will walk you through a "Hello World" later in this weeks content._

## Interface

At this point, if you have not already done so, I would encourage you to open TouchDesigner and follow along.

## Operators

_Operators_ can loosely be thought of as equivalent to _objects_ in Object Oriented Programming (OOP). They are the building blocks for our networks. (_A network is a collection of operators_)

Different signal flows and arrangements of operators result in different outcomes.

**Building Networks (or a collection of interconnect operators...)**

The connections of operators that we create in TouchDesigner are called “Networks.” Just like Max has the convention of calling its work space a patch, and processing (or P5) it’s workspace a sketch, TouchDesigner follows in this pattern by giving it’s workspace a name.

Networks primarily flow as streams of information between nodes of the same family. In Touch this is represented visually as objects/nodes/ops of the same color. _Ops_, short for operators, are the primary building blocks in TouchDesigner networks. Ops, from an abstract viewpoint, represent data types.

- **TOPs -- Texture Operators (purple)** – represent texture / image information. These deal with 2D data and visual operations.
- **CHOPs -- Channel Operators (green)** – are arrays of values. These focus on motion, audio, animation, and control signals.
- **SOPs -- Surface Operators (blue)** – are geometry data – these have all sorts of pieces tied to them, most importantly we need to think of them as spatial data, meaning they deal with 3D points and polygons.
- **MATs -- Materials (yellow)** – are materials and shaders – these are used when we’re doing realtime rendering.
- **DATs -- Data Operators (mauve)** – are data operators – this is where we do all of our scripting and can enter data that’s not an image, list, or geometry.
