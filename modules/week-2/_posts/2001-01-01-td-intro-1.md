The first thing you should do is download the following book;

- [_Introduction to TouchDesigner 099_. sponsored by nVoid. 2019. Available at: nvoid.github.io/book/en/introductiontotouchdesigner.pdf](https://nvoid.github.io/book/en/introductiontotouchdesigner.pdf)

**_{ TODO: }_** We will essentially be learning the content covered through chapter 8. You should read this content while working through the videos (the videos and book are not related, but do both cover the same topics).

## About TouchDesigner

We will be sourcing learning videos and tutorials from a number of locations over the next few weeks (as well as making our own as a class!). However, this week, we are going to primarily utilize one artist, _bileam tschepe_ from Berlin. Please watch the following video describing TouchDesigner from a high level.

## download

If you still need help downloading and/or installing TouchDesigner, please watch the following. However, if you accomplished this last week, then you can skip ahead.

## High Level Topics

### Interface

At this point, if you have not already done so, I would encourage you to open TouchDesigner and follow along.

### Operators

_Operators_ can loosely be thought of as equivalent to _objects_ in Object Oriented Programming (OOP). They are the building blocks for our networks. (_A network is a collection of operators_)

Different signal flows and arrangements of operators result in different outcomes.

**Building Networks (or a collection of interconnect operators...)**

The connections of operators that we create in TouchDesigner are called “Networks.” Just like Max has the convention of calling its work space a patch, and processing (or P5) it’s workspace a sketch, TouchDesigner follows in this pattern by giving it’s workspace a name.

Networks primarily flow as streams of information between nodes of the same family. In Touch this is represented visually as objects/nodes/ops of the same color. _Ops_, short for operators, are the primary building blocks in TouchDesigner networks. Ops, from an abstract viewpoint, represent data types.

**TOPs | Texture Operators (purple)** – represent texture / image information.
**CHOPs | Channel Operators (green)** – are arrays of values.
**SOPs | Surface Operators (blue)** – are geometry data – these have all sorts of pieces tied to them, most importantly we need to think of them as spatial data.
**MATs | Materials (yellow)** – are materials – these are used when we’re doing realtime rendering.
**DATs | Data Operators (mauve)** – are data operators – this is where we do all of our scripting and can enter data that’s not an image, list, or geometry.
