OK, I imagine this was a slightly overwhelming introduction to TouchDesigner. That is OK, it will get easier. Just remember back to MART 120 and the time it took you there! TouchDesigner will utilize this knowledge, as well as any knowledge you have in other media environments (animation, sound, film, etc.).

We will keep pushing next week! More then.
