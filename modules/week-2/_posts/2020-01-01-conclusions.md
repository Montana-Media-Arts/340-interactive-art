OK, I imagine this was a slightly overwhelming introduction to TouchDesigner. That is OK, it will get easier. Just remember back to MART 120 and the time it took you there! TouchDesigner will utilize this knowledge, as well as any knowledge you have in other media environments (animation, sound, film, etc.).

Besides, YOU finally, actually, really, dug into TouchDesigner. Hopefully you had a good experience which resulted in your creation of a WebCam filter. Please remember to utilize the ["Issues Forum"](https://moodle.umt.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=1656989) if you are having problems (and to help your fellow students out who are having issues).

Next week, we will look at the creation of a generative visual work, utilizing other operators.

## Zoom-Sessions

Next week, January 21st, we will continue our weekly Zoom-Based lectures from 1pm-2:20pm.

These will be optional events and will not cover new material. Instead, this will be an opportunity for me to work "in-person" with anyone who can join, for students to ask questions, and for us all to help each other solve TouchDesigner problems. The zoom link is on the main page of the Moodle site.
