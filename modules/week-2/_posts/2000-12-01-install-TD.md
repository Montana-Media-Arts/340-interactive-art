Before we can do anything, the first step is obviously to download and install the software.

## Downloading TouchDesigner

To download TouchDesigner, please go to download page. There you can select the appropriate installer for your operating system. (**{ NOTE: }** Please download the latest _stable_ release.)

- [TouchDesigner Download - derivative.ca/download](https://derivative.ca/download)

After downloading, please follow the operating specific instructions (provided with the download) for installing TouchDesigner on your system.

### License

For this semester, we will be utilizing the [FREE "NON-COMMERCIAL" license](https://derivative.ca/product/touchdesigner-non-commercial).

After downloading TouchDesigner, you will need to register for an account with Derivative (The Parent Company), there you will be able to request and receive a non-commercial license. This license will be good for 1-year, at which point you will need to re-apply for another year's worth of the non-commercial license.

**{ _note_ }:** Follow the install and registration instructions from the Derivative website:

- [https://docs.derivative.ca/Getting_Started_With_TouchDesigner](https://docs.derivative.ca/Getting_Started_With_TouchDesigner)

You are finished with the install if you can open TouchDesigner without a license request popping up.
