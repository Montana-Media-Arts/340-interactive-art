This week, we are going to;

- go over the basics one more time
- examine 2d scene creation
- to start using a basic render network setup
- look at procedural creation of 3D geometry
- and finish with basic shading of 3D objects

There are number of tutorials which will take you 3-6 hours to work through. Therefore we have no homework. Instead, you are expected to keep working on understanding TD, skill acquisition in TD, and preparing yourself to use this software as a creative extension of your voice.
