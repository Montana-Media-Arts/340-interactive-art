When working in environments such as TouchDesigner (or Max/MSP, Isadora, Cinema4D, etc.) we need to be able to setup, understand, and work with rendering environments. You got an introduction to this in the LinkedIn course, I want to slow this process down one more time, and have you work through the following written tutorial, to insure you are feeling comfortable on this process.

To get started on this journey, I want you to read and follow along with Matthew Ragan's excellent overview of Rendering with TouchDesigner.
