After finishing the first three chapters of the LinkedIn course, I would like you to follow along with a series of additional video tutorials and written tutorials.

The first of these is a basic tutorial on compositing. You will need to create your own "grassy knoll" type asset using photoshop (which I know you will all have the ability to do).
