There is a TouchDesigner basics course on LinkedIn Learning which I would like you to work through. As a student of the University of Montana, you have access to this course (and many others)!

To get started, please first visit the LinkedIn Learning link through the UM site.

You will likely need to go through a few steps to get registered, logged in, and setup. Once you are logged in and setup with LinkedIn Learning, please visit the following TouchDesigner course.

Please work through the first 3 chapters.
