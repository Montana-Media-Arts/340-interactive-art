When you have problems in this course, you have a number of solutions available to assist you in solving them. The following list is the order I would suggest you follow for problem solving.

1. Google the problem.
    - A critical skill in creative technology and media art is learning to problem solve. Part of this involves learning how to form a good google query. Your first go to for help should always be google.
2. **Post a discussion to the [General Help and Assistance Forum in Moodle](https://moodle.umt.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=2299977)**.
3. **Get help from our Graduate Teaching Assistant**;
	- [Charlie Apple - charlie.apple@umontana.edu](mailto:charlie.apple@umontana.edu?subject=340%20Question)
4. Get help from the professor [Tina M]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/)
    - If you have a problem, or need help that no one can offer, please contact Tina M.
    - One way to get a hold of me is to schedule a zoom-based, office hours. [Office Hours Fridays 11 am - 1 pm](https://umontana.zoom.us/j/94133489843).
    - You may also email me. (I will check my email at least once a day)
