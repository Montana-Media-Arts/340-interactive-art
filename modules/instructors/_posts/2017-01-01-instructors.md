## Teaching Assistants - Tina and Charlie

We will have two Teaching Assistants to assist you throughout this semester.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course "issues forum" (available through Moodle), you should e-mail one of our TAs for help.

### Tina Mahagamage

Tina is an MFA student who can help you with 3D design and development, visual-based issues/concerns, and as we look at TouchDesigner, she will serve to assist in its similarities to other interactive development environments.
