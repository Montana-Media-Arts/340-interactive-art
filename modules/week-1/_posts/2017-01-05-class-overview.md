Now that you have gone through the syllabus, along with its technical details and policies, let's talk about what this course will actually look like.

## Text & Reading

There will be a lot of reading.  But I will also supplement the course with some synchronous lectures to hopefully help guide and aid along the way. I recognize that this is not easy stuff.  Don't worry! We will get through this together even online!



## Videos

See above in the Text & Reading portion.  I will try and help by creating videos and posting ones that I think are helpful as well.


## Pace

This course takes time. Some things might be easier that others.  However, we will ramp into the course slowly over the next few weeks. But, you should set aside time now in your schedule for course work.

This week is a chance for you to get familiarize yourself with tools on your computer, absorb the syllabus, and schedule out time in your week for class work.


## Dates & Weekly Flow

This course will _mostly_ run as weekly modules.

When a module is released (i.e., it goes live on Moodle and this site), you will have one week to work through it, complete the homework, and submit your homework. You homework will always be due by 11:59 PM on the Monday of the next week.  Please don't wait until 11:59 PM to submit your homework.  Everyone tries and the Moodle might be on hiatus and then sad things can happen.

For example, this module is opening on Monday, January 13th. Therefore, you have through next Monday, January 20th to complete the module. Likewise, your homework is due Saturday by 11:59 PM.


## Homework

You should consider anything within the course lecture content under a *{ TODO: }* section to be part of your "homework".

You will receive additional directives and notes about homework assignments on the Moodle Shell every week.

Most homework assignments will be submitted to a course discussion forum on Moodle. This will allow you and your classmates to see each others assignments, as well as how you each chose to solve the set of problems, without posting links for the whole world to see. You will also be expect to comment and respond to your colleagues works. I think it is critical that you are aware of the work each other is making. This is my current solution to address this need. Further instructions will be provided about how to do this.



## Getting Help

When you have problems in this course, you have a number of solutions available to assist you in solving them. The following list is the order I would suggest you follow for problem solving.

1. Google the problem.
    - A critical skill in creative technology and media art is learning to problem solve. Part of this involves learning how to form a good google query. Your first go to for help should always be google.
2. Post a message to the Course Forum in Moodle.
<!--
[Course Forum in Moodle](https://discord.gg/nbVCKwX)
    - Discord is like a massive chat where everyone can talk to one another in real time and help each other out with issues or just chat.
-->
3. Post to the [course issues forum](https://github.com/Montana-Media-Arts/441-WebTech-Spring2020-examples/issues).
    - In a couple pages, you will follow along with a short tutorial that will help you signup for GitHub, then star and follow the "course repository". Part of this repository is an "issues forum" where you can post questions and problems you are having. These "issues" will be e-mailed to you, and you can then respond to them.
    - The advantage to the GitHub issues forum is its advanced system for including formatted code. This will help with problem solving.
4. Get help from [Michael Cassens]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/#instructor-prof-michael-cassens)
    - If you have a problem, or need help that no one can offer, please contact Michael Cassens.
    - One way to get a hold of me is to swing by my weekly office hours. These are posted (and updated) under my [office hours section]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/#office-hours). This is another way is to email me.
    - If you are a distance student or cannot make one of those times, please email me. (I will check my email multiple times a day)
