Now that you have gone through the syllabus, along with its technical details and policies, let's talk about what this course will actually look like.

## Technical Skill Acquisition and Learning a New Tool

The first half of this semester will be an intense introduction to the real-time render engine and development environment of TouchDesigner. We will focus a lot of energy initially on getting everyone up and feeling comfortable with this tool.

## Text & Reading

There will be a lot of reading since all of the content is presented asynchronously through this website. But I will supplement the course with some synchronous lectures to help guide and aid along the way. I recognize that this is not easy stuff.  Don't worry! We will get through this together even online!



## Videos

See above in the Text & Reading portion.  I will work to create content videos that offer additional information on the content within this website. Likewise, I will post a number of external videos that offer additional information about the content in question.


## Pace

This course takes time. Some things might be easier than others. I highly encourage you to set aside time in your weekly schedule to devote to course work.

This week is a chance for you to  familiarize yourself with tools on your computer, absorb the syllabus, and schedule out time in your week for class work.


## Dates & Weekly Flow

This course will _mostly_ run as weekly modules.

When a module is released (i.e., it goes live on Moodle and this site), you will have one week to work through it, complete the homework, and submit your homework. Your homework will always be due by 11:59 PM on the {{ site.data.course.module-week-day }} of the next week.  Please don't wait until 11:59 PM to submit your homework.  Everyone tries and the Moodle might be on hiatus and then sad things can happen.

For example, Week 2's Module runs from {{ site.data.course.module-week-day }} to {{ site.data.course.module-week-day }}, {{ site.data.dates[2][0] }}. Therefore, you have through next {{ site.data.course.module-week-day }}, {{ site.data.dates[2][1] }} to complete the module and submit your homework. Week 3 will likewise open {{ site.data.course.module-week-day }} and run {{ site.data.dates[3][0] }}



## Homework

You should consider anything within the course lecture content under a *{ TODO: }* section to be part of your "homework".

You will receive additional directives and notes about homework assignments on the Moodle Shell every week.

Most homework assignments will be submitted to a course discussion forum on Moodle. This will allow you and your classmates to see each others assignments, as well as how you each chose to solve the set of problems, without posting links for the whole world to see. You will also be expect to comment and respond to your colleagues works. I think it is critical that you are aware of the work each other is making. This is my current solution to address this need. Further instructions will be provided about how to do this.



## Your Organization

I would encourage you to create a directory (folder) on your local machine, within your cloud-based, [Box-sync](http://www.umt.edu/it/support/box/) or [Microsoft OneDrive](https://umt.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2032/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=45894) directory (folder).

> **_{ Note: }_**
>
> As a University of Montana Student, you have access to two cloud-based storage solutions. You receive 1TB of storage with both [Box](http://www.umt.edu/it/support/box/) and [Microsoft Office 365's OneDrive](https://umt.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/2032/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=45894).
>
> Both of these tools allow you to download an application that creates a local directory (folder) that automatically syncs its contents to the cloud. By storing your work for this class in there, you are;
> - Less likely to experience data loss
> - Will have all of your data available anywhere you may need, so long as you have an internet connection.
>
> I would highly encourage you to use these one of these tools for all of your UM work.





## Getting Help

When you have problems in this course, you have a number of solutions available to assist you in solving them. The following list is the order I would suggest you follow for problem solving.

1. Google the problem.
    - A critical skill in creative technology and media art is learning to problem solve. Part of this involves learning how to form a good google query. Your first go to for help should always be google.
2. Post a discussion to the [**Course Help Forum** in Moodle](https://moodle.umt.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=1955054).
3. Get help from our Graduate Teaching Assistant;
	- [Tina Mahagamage - kristina.mahagamage@umconnect.umt.edu](mailto:kristina.mahagamage@umconnect.umt.edu?subject=340%20Question)
	- [Charlie Apple - charlie.apple@umontana.edu](mailto:charlie.apple@umontana.edu?subject=340%20Question)
4. Get help from the professor [Michael Musick]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/)
    - If you have a problem, or need help that no one can offer, please contact Michael Musick.
    - One way to get a hold of me is to schedule a zoom-based, office hours appointment via [Calendly]({{site.baseurl}}/instructors/#Office-Hours).
    - You may also email me. (I will check my email at least once a day)
