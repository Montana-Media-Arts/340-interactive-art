That is it for Week 1. I hope you are excited for this course and everything we are going to learn this semester.

I know you likely still feel a little lost as to what this semester will look like. We will take it together though and it is going to be great. I am excited for the projects you are going to create over the next 13 weeks.

Remember, if you need help, you should try using the course ["Issues Forum" hosted on Moodle](https://moodle.umt.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=1656989).
