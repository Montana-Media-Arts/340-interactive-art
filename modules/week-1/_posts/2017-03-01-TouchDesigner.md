As mentioned earlier in this weeks content, this course will also explore the development environment of TouchDesigner.

TouchDesigner is a node-based visual programming language for real time interactive multimedia content. It's used by artists, programmers, creative coders, software designers, and performers to create interactive artworks, performances, installations, sculptures, AR/VR experiences, as well as fixed-media works.

We are going to use TouchDesigner this semester in order to insure that all students are utilizing the same technology, and to provide a common language/environment for the technical discussion of interactive concepts.

For this week, I want you to download, install, and cursorily explore TouchDesigner.

## Downloading TouchDesigner

To download TouchDesigner, please go to download page. There you can select the appropriate installer for your operating system.

After downloading, please follow the operating specific instructions (provided with the download) for installing TouchDesigner on your system.

### License

For this semester, we will be utilizing the [FREE "NON-COMMERCIAL" license](https://derivative.ca/product/touchdesigner-non-commercial).

After downloading TouchDesigner, you will need to register for an account with Derivative (The Parent Company), there you will be able to request and receive a non-commercial license. This license will be good for 1-year, at which point you will need to apply for another years worth of the non-commercial license.

**{ _note_ }:** Follow the install and registration instructions from the Derivative website:

You are finished with the install if you can open TouchDesigner without a license request popping up.
