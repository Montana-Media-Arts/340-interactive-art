> As an immersive interactive artist who specializes in acquiring advanced skills through various high-end software, I create works that invoke empathic or emotional experiences for participants. My work consists of a collection of interactive experiences that examine different modalities of interactivity and experiential design.  

My expertise is on Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality development and design including CG asset creation and creative coding. 

I am a recent graduate of the Media Arts MFA program with years of teaching design and development under my belt.  I completed my undergrad at Otis College of Art and Desing in Digital Media with a minor in creative writing and storytelling.


## Teaching Assistant - Charlie Apple

We will have a Teaching Assistant to assist you throughout this semester.

If you are unable to solve problems on your own or through the course "issues forum" (available through Moodle), you should e-mail our TA for help.

### Charlie Apple

Charlie is an MFA student in his second year of study with the department. Charlie is a musician also focused in how interactive technologies and art can augment music. He will serve particularly well for students having technical problems with TouchDesigner, needing feedback on sound/audio, and with interactive issues.
