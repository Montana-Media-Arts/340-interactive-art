For this first week, you should do and submit the following as either a single .zip package, or as individual document uploaded to the relevant homework assignment.

## 1. Screenshot of your note program

To start this week, please take a screenshot of your note system. When you take this screen shot, I would like you to have a note pulled up of your "initial thoughts of interactivity".

## 2. Response to Edmonds, “The Art of Interaction.”

After reading the article from the [_Intro to Interactivity_ page]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-1/interactive-intro/#further-reading), please write a response that begins to define a more concrete idea of what "interactivity" is to you.

You should write this into a "note", in your notes system. Then export this note as either a text document, or pdf document. You will submit this exported document.

## 3. TouchDesigner

Please make sure TouchDesigner is installed and will open up. You do not need to submit anything for that this week.

## Submission

When you are finished, please submit these two files to the [Week 1 Assignment Submission]().
