Please read the [Syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus/) for the course in its entirety. The version on this website, as well as the one in your Moodle shell are identical.

You can get to the Syllabus from the tab up above in the navigation bar, or directly from [Syllabus]({{site.baseurl}}/syllabus/).
