There is one informational item for you...

I am expecting my first child any day. Which I am of course, incredibly excited for.

For this semester, my plan is as follows:

- When my wife goes into labor, I will be alerting my graduate assistants.
- At that point, for a two week period, they will be the primary point of contact
- Likewise, I will not hold office hours for those two weeks
- The course however, will proceed, without significant interruptions
- When I am back from those initial two weeks, I will make sure you know that I will be available for contact and help again
