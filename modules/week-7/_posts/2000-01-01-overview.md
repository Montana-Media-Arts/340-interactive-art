This week, you are to recreate, **then push beyond** Simon's tutorial that explores generative art utilizing a 3D workflow. The goal of this is for you to continue building up your TouchDesigner skills and knowledge, so that we can start moving towards your ability to use TouchDesigner as an extension of your artistic voice.

As far as new content, there is one tutorial for this week. There are number of readings associated with this tutorial, that I also want you to read through.

For your homework this week, I want you to create a derivative artwork based on this tutorial.
