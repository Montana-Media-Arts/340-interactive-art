This week you continued to dig into TouchDesigner. Hopefully you had a good experience which resulted in your creation of an engaging noise displacement piece. Please remember to utilize the **Moodle Issues Forum** if you are having problems (and to help your fellow students out who are having issues).

Next week, we will look at the creation of a generative visual work, utilizing other operators. We will also start to examine how Feedback can help us quickly build up complex works.
