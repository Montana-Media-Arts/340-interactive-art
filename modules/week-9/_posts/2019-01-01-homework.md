As this week is about daily sketch practices, your homework this week is to start a practice of daily sketching.

## Specifications

- **Create** something every day.
- **Iterate**. This does not need to be completely original or new every day, it just needs to be done and completed.
- **Document**. You need to create a documentation video of your thing for everyday. This can be as short as 5 second and as long as 30-60 seconds.
- **Save**. Make sure you save your sketch, documentation, and associated work.

## Deliverables

You combine 6 sketch videos to the a demo-style reel. Please upload this video to the hw submission forum.
