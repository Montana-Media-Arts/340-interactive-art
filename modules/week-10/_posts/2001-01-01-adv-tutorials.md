The last goal for this week is for you to tackle an advanced tutorial, where you continue to move in a direction that you find most interesting and engaging for yourself.

The following pages contain possible suggested tutorials that you could choose to follow. You would of course duplicate the tutorial, then push the project further, iterating or going beyond in some way that makes this your own work.

- You are welcome to use one of the tutorials we have suggested.
- Likewise, you are also welcome to find another tutorial that you have not yet completed, that you think would be interesting or beneficial to your long-term goals.

> Please use this opportunity to keep exploring in directions that are useful to you. If you are unsure where to start or look, reach out, we can have a conversation and do some looking together.

## Deliverables

1. Follow the submission guide from [Week 2](https://montana-media-arts.github.io/340-interactive-art/modules/week-2/homework/) .

1. TouchDesigner Network
	1. You are required to submit your TouchDesigner Network this week.
	2. To do this, you will need to _zip_ the containing project folder for the network.
	3. If you have any media assets that you are utilizing (_this would only be the case if you added something beyond the tutorial_), please remember to include those within the network project directory, so that they are also zipped.
2. Screen Shots, Capture, and Renders
	1. Create a video of your TouchDesigner work using the [_Movie File Out_ operator, as discussed in this week]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-3/recordVideoOut/) 
	2. Alternatively, you can use [OBS to take a screen recording of your TouchDesigner network and resulting output]({{site.baseurl}}/modules/week-2/captureYourDisplay/).
	3. (If you have audio) Include Audio in your final submission video
	4. Take detailed Screen Shots of your node network for documentation.
3. Write Up: Provide written documentation of process and experience with this project.
	1. Explain the concept.  Describe the visual.
	2. How is it interactive?
	3. What problems did you run into this week, and how did you solve them? 
	4. What's next? How would you push this further?
	5. How was your experience working in TouchDesigner this week?  How would you approach this project differently?
