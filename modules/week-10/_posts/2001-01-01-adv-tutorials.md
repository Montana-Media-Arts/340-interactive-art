The last goal for this week is for you to tackle an advanced tutorial, where you continue to move in a direction that you find most interesting and engaging for yourself.

The following pages contain possible suggested tutorials that you could choose to follow. You would of course duplicate the tutorial, then push the project further, iterating or going beyond in some way that makes this your own work.

- You are welcome to use one of the tutorials we have suggested.
- Likewise, you are also welcome to find another tutorial that you have not yet completed, that you think would be interesting or beneficial to your long-term goals.

> Please use this opportunity to keep exploring in directions that are useful to you. If you are unsure where to start or look, reach out, we can have a conversation and do some looking together.

Submit your project, as you have for all other weekly projects, to the appropriate Moodle Homework Submission Forum for this week.
