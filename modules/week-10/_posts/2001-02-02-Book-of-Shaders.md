Another unique approach that involves GLSL would include you deep diving through the open-source book, [The Book of Shaders](https://thebookofshaders.com). The code for this book was ported to TouchDesigner by Matthew Ragan, [https://github.com/raganmd/BOS-in-TouchDesigner](https://github.com/raganmd/BOS-in-TouchDesigner).

If you go this route, please go as deep as you can in the book, and create a work using the techniques available for GLSL.
