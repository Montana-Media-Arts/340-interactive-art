Runway ML is Machine Learning powered video editing and creation platform. Through advanced machine learning techniques, this platform can create cutting-edge content, only possible through the use of algorithmic machine-learning.

To get started with Machine Learning and Runway ML, please watch the following short video.

The resulting videos you create with Runway ML can be imported for use in TouchDesigner (such as to the [Curl Noise project]({{site.baseurl}}//)), or any other TD framework that uses a `movie file in`.
