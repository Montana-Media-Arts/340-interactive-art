This week, we are going to;

- go over the basics one more time
- examine 2D scene creation
- to start using a basic render network setup
- look at procedural creation of 3D geometry
- and finish with basic shading of 3D objects

There are number of tutorials which will take you 3-6 hours to work through. You are expected to keep working on understanding TD, skill acquisition in TD, and preparing yourself to use this software as a creative extension of your voice. This will culminate this week in your choosing of one of the tutorials to push further, into a homework assignment.
