Please follow along with the proceeding tutorial videos from [Matthew Ragan's site](https://matthewragan.com/2015/03/29/thp-494-598-generative-design-shape-and-noise-touchdesigner/).

These tutorials explore generative art, as explored and explained from the [Generative Design Book](http://www.generative-gestaltung.de/1/) TD port via the [Derivative website](https://docs.derivative.ca/index.php?title=Generative_Design).

## Shape

**Core Concepts**

  * Drawing with pseudo random numbers (Noise)
* moving between data types – SOP to CHOP, CHOP to SOP
* Noise CHOP and SOP
* Rendering
* Feedback Networks
* Sampling images for pixel values – ex: *op(‘noise1’).sample(x=0 , y=0)[0]*

## Noise

**Core Concepts**

* Instancing (with Psychedelic Jamboree colors – or with a Ramp)
* Noise CHOP
* Cross CHOP
* Orthographic Camera
* Feedback
