This week you finally, actually, really, dug into TouchDesigner. Hopefully you had a good experience which resulted in your creation of a WebCam filter. Please remember to utilize the ["Issues Forum"](https://moodle.umt.edu/mod/hsuforum/view.php?id=1656989) if you are having problems (and to help your fellow students out who are having issues).

Next week, we will look at the creation of a generative visual work, utilizing other operators. We will also start to examine how Feedback can help us quickly build up complex works.

## Zoom-Sessions

Next week, January 21st, we will continue our weekly Zoom-Based lectures from 1pm-:2:20pm.

These will be optional events and will not cover new material. Instead, this will be an opportunity for me to work "in-person" with anyone who can join, for students to ask questions, and for us all to help each other solve TouchDesigner problems. The zoom link is on the main page of the Moodle site.
