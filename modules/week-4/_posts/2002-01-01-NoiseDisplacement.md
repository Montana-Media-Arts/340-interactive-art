This weeks primary content comes from [Simon Alexander-Adams](https://www.simonaa.media), who is a media artist, interaction designer, and musician out of Detroit, MI. The tutorial examines the use of "noise" as visual source and displacement data in a generative art work. Please head to Simon's page hosting this tutorial, read through his discussions around noise, randomness, and displacement.

I would also like you to read the linked articles with further information on these subjects.
