So far, we've looked at how to utilize a simple webcam to create interactivity.  TouchDesigner has several methods and modalities of interactivity that we will explore throughout this course.  In this lesson, we will look at some simple User Based Inputs, like a keyboard input or mouse tracking. 

Continuing with the feedback example project, let's add some User Based interactivity.
