So far, we've looked at how to utilize a simple webcam to create interactivity.  TouchDesigner has several methods and modalities of interactivity that we will explore throughout this course.  In this lesson, we will look at some simple User Based Inputs, like a keyboard input or mouse tracking. 

Continuing with the feedback example project, let's add some User Based interactivity.


## Simple Keyboard Input

Let's look at a simple keyboard input to control the reset of the feedback.

## Controller using Keyboard Inputs

In this example, let's create a simple up, down, right, left controller using keyboard inputs.

## Simple Mouse Tracking and Click Command

Now that we know how to use keyboard inputs, let's apply the same logic to mouse tracking and click commands.  This tutorial will look at using mouse tracking and click commands to create an interative drawing experience.

## Mouse Click and Color Switch

Pushing this project further, let's use what we learned with click commands to create a color change using a switch node.  The click command will drive the switch which does the color change.

In the next section, we will look at more advanced tools and techniques for feedback and user input interactivity.
