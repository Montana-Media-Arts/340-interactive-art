This week, we will work through a very basic TouchDesigner network. Additionally, you will learn how to take screen captures of your computer. The main goal for you this week is to start actually exploring and creating in TouchDesigner, now that you have had an opportunity to learn more about all of its individual pieces over the last two weeks.
