# Sp 2021 Planning

	- Tuesday to Tuesday

	- Thursdays @ 1pm




# Fall 2020 Recap with TAâ€™s - Nov 16, 2020

# Weekly Overview

## Week 1
- Add a better overview of TD
	- What can TD do
	- why is it so cool
	- why are we teaching it
- Needs videos
- Need to complete the hello world or TD

## Week 2 & 3
- Combine weeks 2 & 3
	- **Do we even need these weeks and their content???**

## Week 4
- Perhaps this should be in Week 2?
- This can be where I introduce the parts of an interactive system

# Weekly Plan

1. Intro to Course
2. Hello World in TD (Week 4)
3. bileam tshcepe intro course + basic compositing
	1. Daily Sketching???
		2. Turn in 4 compositing pieces

**Add More**

- Audio Reactive



# Potential Format

Split class into three general sections

1. Intro to TD + Interactive Theory Basics
2. Gallery Interactive art
3. Performance Interactive Art




# What Are The Goals of This Class

- Interactive Art Theory
	- Move away from a product or visual based art piece (artifact), towards experience as art
	- Breakdown interactive experience into its constituent parts
- Breakdown an interactive system, in to its constituent parts
- Tools as what they are, _tools_



# General Thoughts from Fall 2020

- Asynch is difficult, need a weekly zoom-supplement
	- Need to add a weekly zoom-based class option
		- 1.5 hrs long
- How can we move TD to a tool, vs the only thing this course is about...
	- TD is just one tool of a bunch
- How do we deal with research and documentation
	- Maybe have Tina develop a documentation module/section?
		- This could during the first third
		- or perhaps during the latter half of the class, as the "lab section" after finishing the TD lab stuff
			- This likely needs to be a separate graded assignment
		- Perhaps have a "pitch" project (project proposal)
- For writing, need to help push more formal writing. Maybe encourage 3rd person voice.
	- Empower Tina to help students with writing. Allow her to email class to improve writing, with general/specific thoughts.
- Need to have a conversation, at the start of the semester, about how we want to approach documentation in this class.

# THINGS TO ADD
- More projects
- Another major critique
	- Maybe 2 (for a total of 3)
- More on interactive art theory




# Calendar Updates

Sp 2020 is a full 15 weeks. With a finals week afterwards.
